# OOP Principles and Design Patterns

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that structures code around "objects" rather than functions and logic. This approach aims to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program.

## Encapsulation

> Encapsulation is bundling data (properties) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (the class). This protects data integrity and controls access to internal states using access modifiers (public, protected, private).

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of OOP. It is crucial because it enables a high level of data integrity by shielding an object's internal state from unwanted interference and misuse.
