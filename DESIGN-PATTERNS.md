# OOP Design Patterns

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.




# OOP Design Patterns

Design patterns are established, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are not specific pieces of code that can be directly copied and pasted, but rather blueprints or templates that guide developers in structuring their code to achieve specific design goals.

Design patterns are typically categorized into three main types based on their intent:

- **Creational Patterns:** Focus on object creation mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a way that decouples the client from the concrete classes being instantiated.
    
- **Structural Patterns:**Â  Deal with the composition of objects and classes, simplifying the design by identifying relationships between entities.

- **Behavioral Patterns:**Â  Address the communication and interaction between objects, defining how objects collaborate to achieve a task.
